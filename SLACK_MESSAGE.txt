Hey team! 👋

Just wrapped up Iteration 3 of the Voice AI Pipeline. Quick highlights:

**✅ Completed:**
- Full iOS Safari support (dual audio strategy)
- RAG document system with local embeddings (beyond original scope)
- Zero-latency context retrieval (parallel execution)
- Frontend 2.0 redesign with better UX
- All bugs fixed (memory leaks, auto-scroll, etc.)

**📊 Metrics:**
- Turn latency: 600-900ms ✅
- Cancellation rate: 20-25% ✅
- Cost: $0 embeddings (local processing)
- iOS delay: 1-2s (acceptable trade-off)
